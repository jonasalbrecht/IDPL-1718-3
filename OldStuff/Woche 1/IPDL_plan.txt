Scope:
	Module: NumPy
	Technologies: Python(scrapy, spark, Keras/Tensorflow)
	Requirements: 
		- program learns from structured, clean datasets.
		- program takes questions in natural language (english) and responds with code
		- program should not provide not runnable code

Milestones:

1 - Extract and safe Data 

	1.1 - from:
	- Stack overflow
	- Python documentation
	- NumPy Documentation
	- Gist, GitHub, etc.
	- pretty Code examples (many comments)

	1.2 - How to extract

		- Stackoverflow dump
		- Python webcrawler (e.g. scrapy)
		- (Stackoverflow) APIs

	1.3 - Find Data Model
		save as:
		- JSON ?
		- MongoDB ?
		- SQLite ?

2 - Clean Data

	- filter unnecessary words (e.g. spark wordcount, python script) OR
	- NN for classification of words (relevant/irrelevant)
	- Code checks for validity: determine how to do checks
	- unify variable names 
	- seperate example "setup" from the core code functionality <- what 

3 - Attempt to train Recurrent Neural Network for

	(to be determined)
	- API sequences (like in the paper Deep API learning)
	- Complete code fragments
	- Extracting variable types, or even roles

4 - Use the NN

	- command line interpreter
	- Webinterface or PlugIn
